Hey! You've stumbled across README, a fun, concise guide to Hack Club, our community, and programming in general. We're glad to have you!

Hack Club is a global community of teen artists, writers, coders, makers, designers, and hackers building the agency, the network, & the technical talent to think big & do big things in the world. We run hundreds of clubs in schools around the world, provide grants, funding, & resources to help young people build projects that matter to them, and host events & workshops to help our community learn new skills. Hack Clubbers also go on incredible adventures together - from coding on a train across Canada to building a pop-up arcade in Tokyo!

I joined Hack Club in May of 2024, and while it has been the most transformative experience of my life, I still remember how overwhelming it felt at first.
