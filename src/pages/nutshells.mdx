hi!! this is an internal page that contains the content of the Nutshells that we link to throughout README. feel free to read through them here!

## : wait, who are you?

(heyo! when I have a side tangent or extra info, i'll shove it into one of these Nutshells! you can even embed them in your own site by clicking the Nutshell icon in the corner of the bubble, or on any header!!)

hi! i'm [hex4](https://hex4.xyz). i'm a middle schooler, community member at Hack Club and the maintainer of README. coding & computers have changed my life for the better, and i'm so grateful that I now get to share that joy with others through Hack Club.

aside from coding, I snowboard, rock climb, design in Figma, play D&D, draw terrible pixel art, and a whole lot of nerd stuff in general. if you need help with anything, [dm me on Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U071JHBEJ7R)!

README is an open source project, and so many people have contributed to it over time. Thank you to:

## : component: clubs

<Emoji name="hackclub-party"/> Hack Clubs are student-led after-school coding clubs where teens are building the class they wish they could take. Hack Clubs usually meet once a week after school, and members participate in workshops, build awesome technical projects, and demo them to their peers and the world 🌎

Club leaders get access to a huge library of free [workshops](https://workshops.hackclub.com) and [jams](https://jams.hackclub.com) to help their members learn new skills, as well as free stickers & posters, a nonprofit fund via [HCB](https://hcb.hackclub.com) to help fundraise, and a supportive community of other club leaders around the world.

## : wait, what's a "hacker?"

good question! contrary to popular belief, a "hacker" isn't someone who breaks into computer systems or does anything illegal. a hacker is simply someone who solves problems in creative ways - usually with code. hackers build, iterate, break, and ship things that make the world better. if you're someone who likes to tinker, create, and learn new things, then congratulations: you're a hacker!
