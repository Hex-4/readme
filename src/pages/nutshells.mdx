hi!! this is an internal page that contains the content of the Nutshells that we link to throughout README. feel free to read through them here!

## : wait, who are you?

hi! i'm [hex4](https://hex4.xyz). i'm a middle schooler, community member at Hack Club and the maintainer of README. coding & computers have changed my life for the better, and i'm so grateful that I now get to share that joy with others through Hack Club.

aside from coding, I snowboard, rock climb, design in Figma, play D&D, draw terrible pixel art, and a whole lot of nerd stuff in general. if you need help with anything, [dm me on Slack](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U071JHBEJ7R)!

README is an open source project, and so many people have contributed to it over time. Thank you to:

## : wait, what's a "hacker?"

good question! contrary to popular belief, a "hacker" isn't someone who breaks into computer systems or does anything illegal. a hacker is simply someone who solves problems in creative ways - usually with code. hackers build, iterate, break, and ship things that make the world better. if you're someone who likes to tinker, create, and learn new things, then congratulations: you're a hacker!
